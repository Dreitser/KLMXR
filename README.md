## Meeting the Demands of Modern Aviation  
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and its regional subsidiary, KLM Cityhopper, emphasize top-notch training for their workforce of over 33,000 and fleet of 110 aircraft. This ensures reliability and safety for the 34.1 million passengers and 621,000 units of cargo they transport annually.  

However, managing such a vast workforce and extensive asset catalog presents challenges, including time-consuming and costly training.  

To address these challenges, KLM’s **XR Center of Excellence (XRCoE)** leveraged Unity’s XR technology to develop the **KLM Cityhopper Virtual Reality Cockpit Trainer**, achieving:  
- Significant reductions in iteration time  
- Full immersion for trainees using the latest headset technology  
- Enhanced quality and customization of training scenarios  

Explore how KLM transformed their training process and overcame the shortcomings of outdated methods.

### **Challenges of Conventional Training Methods**  
- **Outdated Materials**: Physical resources and outdated platforms like IPT simulators were difficult to update and distribute globally.  
- **Poor Adaptability**: Traditional methods lacked scalability and flexibility, often leading to inefficiencies and scheduling conflicts.

## The Solution: KLM Cityhopper Virtual Reality Cockpit Trainer  

The XRCoE team, composed of **16 members**, including **7 certified Unity developers**, created the trainer for the Embraer **E175** and **E190** aircraft.  

### **Key Features**  
1. **Virtual Cockpit**: An interactive environment for exploring control panels and practicing procedures.  
2. **360-Degree Video**: An immersive point-of-view flight experience to enhance situational awareness.  
3. **Virtual Walkaround**: A lifelike 3D model for familiarization with aircraft features.  

> *“The VR headset literally opens a new world for future Embraer pilots. They can train wherever and whenever they want.”*  
> **– Ernst Pontier, Captain & Senior Instructor, KLM Cityhopper**

### **Why Use Unity to Build a Training Application?**  

#### **Faster Prototyping**  
- Used **high-fidelity cameras** and **LiDAR scanners** to build accurate 3D models.  
- Unity's tools enabled quick prototyping and visualization for iterative development.  

#### **Smooth Performance and Iteration**  
- Multi-platform support ensured seamless deployment to Meta Quest 3.  
- Real-time testing and visualization reduced build and deploy cycles.

> *“Iterating and testing is easy with Unity. We can edit on the fly, saving time and improving quality.”*  
> **– Lex Dreitser, XR Lead Developer**  

#### **Improved Visual Quality and Customization**  
- Leveraged **custom shaders** and materials for enhanced visuals.  
- Developed a procedure node system for streamlined feature creation.  

#### **Streamlined Asset Management**  
- Tested Unity Asset Manager for efficient distribution and updates, with plans for future integration into KLM’s IT infrastructure.  

> *“The ability to manage assets

Streamlined asset management: Throughout their journey of building the KLM Cityhopper Virtual Reality Cockpit Trainer, KLM tested the Unity Asset Manager to manage assets within the Unity Editor. The company is still testing to ensure that the Unity Asset Manager can be integrated within their IT infrastructure, but they did see the solution as a major advantage for streamlining asset management.
